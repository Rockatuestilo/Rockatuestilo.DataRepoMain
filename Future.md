### **Summary of Gaps**
From your provided schema:
1. **Insufficient flexibility**: The schema is tied to rigid structures (e.g., hardcoded categories and types).
2. **Lack of modularity**: Missing features like custom fields, flexible menus, or reusable components.
3. **Scalability concerns**: Current tables like `CMSLog` may grow without effective purging or archiving.
